DataSource: The DataSource is a central component in the Spring JDBC framework. It provides a connection to the database and manages the pooling of database connections, improving performance and scalability.

JdbcTemplate: The JdbcTemplate is the core class in the Spring JDBC framework. It encapsulates common JDBC operations, such as executing SQL statements, processing query results, and handling exceptions. It simplifies database access by managing resource acquisition and release automatically.

NamedParameterJdbcTemplate: The NamedParameterJdbcTemplate extends the functionality of JdbcTemplate by allowing named parameters in SQL queries instead of traditional positional parameters. This improves the readability and maintainability of SQL statements.

RowMapper: The RowMapper interface is used to map the result of a database query to Java objects. It provides a way to extract data from the ResultSet and convert it into domain objects or data transfer objects (DTOs).

Transaction management: The Spring JDBC framework integrates with Spring's transaction management capabilities. It allows you to declaratively define transaction boundaries using annotations or XML configuration, ensuring ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for database operations.

Exception handling: The Spring JDBC framework provides a consistent exception hierarchy that translates database-specific exceptions into Spring's DataAccessException hierarchy. This simplifies error handling and promotes a consistent approach to exception management.

Batch processing: Spring JDBC offers batch processing capabilities, allowing you to execute multiple database operations as a batch. This improves performance by reducing the overhead of individual database round trips.

Stored procedures: The framework provides support for executing stored procedures and retrieving their results. It simplifies the usage of stored procedures by providing APIs to handle input and output parameters.
